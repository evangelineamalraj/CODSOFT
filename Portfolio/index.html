        <h1>I'm a Web<br> <span>Developer</span></h1>
        <p>“I’m a Computer Science Engineer interested in web development” 
        I enjoy making websites and learning new technologies. I recently created some websites for my project work!
        And always looking for new things to do!! 
        I have a range of skills that I have developed through my education and project experience. Some of the skills that I have are HTML, CSS, JavaScript. 
        I have used these skills to create the websites. For example, I recently created a website for a To Do list, that helps us to assign a task and complete quickly . 
        I just used HTML, CSS for design and style the web page.
         The result was a responsive and user-friendly website.!!!

            <h1>About <span>Me</span></h1>
            <h3>Hello! I'm Evangeline  A.</h3>
            <p>I completed an online internship in web development at PSNA College of Engineering and Technology. 
            I worked on various web development projects using HTML, CSS.
            For example, one of the projects I worked on was a dynamic and responsive website of to-do list. 
            The result was a user-friendly and attractive website. I learned a lot from this internship experience.
             I improved my technical skills, gained practical experience, and developed my problem-solving and communication skills.
             I also learned how to work in a team, manage deadlines. I believe that this internship experience has prepared 
             me for the web development role at the organization and I’m confident that I can apply my skills and knowledge 
             to create high-quality websites for the clients.
